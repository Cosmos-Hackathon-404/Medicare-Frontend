## Chief Complaint
Burning sensation in the upper abdomen and chest (heartburn) for 2 months, worsening after meals and when lying down. Associated with frequent belching and acid taste in the mouth. One episode of vomiting with blood-streaked content last week.

## History of Present Illness
Mr. Mehta presents with a 2-month history of progressive epigastric burning and retrosternal burning that worsens 30–60 minutes after meals, particularly after spicy or fatty food. Symptoms are aggravated in the supine position and partially relieved by antacids (temporary). He reports 3–4 episodes of acid regurgitation per week and frequent belching. One week ago, he had a single episode of vomiting with coffee-ground material (approximately 50 mL) — no recurrence since. He denies dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, melena, or change in bowel habits. He has been taking Ibuprofen 400 mg occasionally for back pain (3–4 times/week for the past month). He also reports increased work-related stress.

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Upper GI Endoscopy (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy — EGD)
**Findings:**
- **Esophagus**: Los Angeles Grade B erosive esophagitis — linear mucosal erosions > 5 mm in the distal esophagus at 2 sites, not extending between tops of mucosal folds. No Barrett's changes. No stricture.
- **Gastroesophageal Junction**: Irregular Z-line. Hill Grade II flap valve.
- **Stomach**: Diffuse antral erythema and edema. **Two antral erosions** (3–4 mm each) with surrounding hyperemia — no active bleeding. No ulcer crater. Fundus and body — normal. No mass lesion.
- **Duodenum**: D1 — mild erythema. D2 — normal.
- **Biopsies taken**: 2 from antrum (RUT + histology), 2 from distal esophagus

**Rapid Urease Test (CLO test)**: **Positive** (confirms active H. pylori infection)

### Histopathology Report (received September 22, 2025)
- **Antral biopsies**: Chronic active gastritis with moderate H. pylori colonization. Intestinal metaplasia — **absent**. Dysplasia — **absent**.
- **Esophageal biopsies**: Squamous epithelium with basal cell hyperplasia, papillary elongation, and scattered intraepithelial eosinophils (8/HPF). Consistent with **reflux esophagitis**. No Barrett's metaplasia. No dysplasia.

## Assessment & Diagnosis
1. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)** — Los Angeles Grade B erosive esophagitis
2. **H. pylori-positive chronic active gastritis** with antral erosions
3. **NSAID-induced gastropathy** (contributing factor — frequent Ibuprofen use)
4. **Coffee-ground vomiting** — likely from antral erosions (no active bleeding at EGD)
5. **Early iron deficiency** — likely secondary to chronic gastric erosions and occult GI blood loss
6. **Known comorbidities**: T2DM (improving), HTN (not at goal), NAFLD (Grade II), dyslipidemia

## Plan

### H. pylori Eradication (Standard Triple Therapy × 14 days)
1. **Pantoprazole** 40 mg BD (before meals)
2. **Amoxicillin** 1 g BD
3. **Clarithromycin** 500 mg BD
4. *(Note: Sulfonamide allergy documented — penicillin safe; Amoxicillin chosen over Metronidazole as first-line)*

### GERD Management
5. Continue **Pantoprazole 40 mg BD** for 8 weeks total (post H. pylori course, step down to OD)
6. **Lifestyle modifications**:
   - Elevate head of bed 6 inches
   - Avoid eating 3 hours before bedtime
   - Reduce spicy, fatty, acidic foods; avoid coffee and carbonated drinks
   - Weight loss (reinforce — target BMI < 25)

### NSAID Gastropathy
7. **STOP Ibuprofen immediately** — absolute contraindication with active erosions
8. For back pain: Switch to **Paracetamol 650 mg** PRN (max 3x/day)
9. If stronger analgesia needed: Consider Tramadol short-course (discuss with referring physician)
10. Continue Aspirin 75 mg — benefit outweighs risk; covered by PPI

### Iron Deficiency
11. **Ferrous Ascorbate 100 mg + Folic Acid** OD × 3 months; recheck CBC + iron studies at 3 months

### Follow-up
12. **H. pylori eradication confirmation**: Urea Breath Test — 4 weeks after completing antibiotics (must be off PPI for 2 weeks prior)
13. **Repeat EGD in 8 weeks** — confirm erosion healing and esophagitis resolution
14. **Follow-up with Dr. Sharma** for HTN optimization (BP still not at goal)
15. If symptoms persist despite treatment → consider esophageal pH monitoring / manometry
