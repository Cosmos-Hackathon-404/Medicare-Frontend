## Chief Complaint
Severe lower back pain radiating to the left leg for 6 weeks. Pain worsens with prolonged sitting and bending forward. Numbness and tingling in the left foot for the past 2 weeks.

## History of Present Illness
Mr. Mehta reports a 6-week history of progressive lower back pain (lumbosacral region) that began after lifting a heavy suitcase during travel. Initial pain was localized to the lower back but has since started radiating down the posterior aspect of the left thigh, calf, and into the lateral foot (L5-S1 dermatomal distribution). He rates the back pain 6/10 and leg pain 7/10 on the visual analogue scale. Pain is aggravated by sitting > 30 minutes, forward bending, coughing, and sneezing. It is partially relieved by lying supine with knees flexed. He reports numbness and tingling in the left lateral foot for 2 weeks. Denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, or bilateral leg weakness. He has been using Paracetamol 650 mg as needed (following GI advice to avoid NSAIDs — see GI visit September 2025).

He works a desk job with 8–10 hours of sitting daily. Exercise compliance has been poor since the back pain started.

## Musculoskeletal & Neurological Examination

### Inspection
- Antalgic gait (leaning to the right to offload left side)
- Loss of normal lumbar lordosis
- Mild paraspinal muscle spasm (left > right)

### Palpation
- Tenderness over L4-L5 and L5-S1 spinous processes
- Left paraspinal muscle tightness
- No step deformity

### Range of Motion (Lumbar Spine)
| Movement | Range | Pain |
|---|---|---|
| Flexion | 40° (limited) | Severe — reproduces leg pain |
| Extension | 20° (limited) | Moderate back pain |
| Left lateral bending | 15° (limited) | Moderate |
| Right lateral bending | 25° | Mild |
| Rotation | Mildly limited bilaterally | Mild |

### Special Tests
| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Straight Leg Raise (Left) | **Positive at 35°** — radiating pain to left foot |
| Straight Leg Raise (Right) | Negative |
| Crossed SLR | Positive (raising right leg reproduces left leg pain — suggests large disc) |
| Femoral Nerve Stretch | Negative |
| Slump Test | Positive (left) |

### Neurological Assessment
| Parameter | Left | Right |
|---|---|---|
| L4 (Knee extension) | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| L5 (Great toe dorsiflexion) | **4/5 (weak)** | 5/5 |
| S1 (Ankle plantar flexion) | **4+/5** | 5/5 |
| S1 (Ankle jerk reflex) | **Diminished** | Normal |
| L4 (Knee jerk reflex) | Normal | Normal |
| Sensation — L5 dermatome | **Decreased (lateral calf, dorsum of foot)** | Normal |
| Sensation — S1 dermatome | Mildly decreased (lateral foot) | Normal |
| Perianal sensation | **Intact** | **Intact** |
| Bladder function | Normal | — |

## Diagnostic Investigations

### X-Ray Lumbosacral Spine (AP + Lateral)
- Loss of lumbar lordosis (muscle spasm)
- Mild disc space narrowing at L5-S1
- Marginal osteophytes at L4-L5 and L5-S1 (early degenerative changes)
- No spondylolisthesis
- No fracture or bony destruction
- Sacroiliac joints — normal

### MRI Lumbosacral Spine (Plain)
**Findings:**
- **L4-L5**: Diffuse disc bulge with mild bilateral foraminal narrowing. No significant neural compression. Disc desiccation (Pfirrmann Grade III).
- **L5-S1**: **Left posterolateral disc herniation** (8 × 6 mm) with **inferior migration**, causing significant compression of the **left S1 nerve root** in the lateral recess. Disc desiccation (Pfirrmann Grade IV). Mild annular tear (High Intensity Zone on T2).
- **L5-S1**: Mild **left L5 nerve root** impingement at the foraminal level.
- **Conus medullaris**: Normal position (terminating at L1 level). No signal abnormality.
- **Cauda equina**: No compression. No crowding.
- **Vertebral bodies**: Normal height and signal. No marrow edema.
- **Facet joints**: Mild bilateral facet arthropathy at L4-L5 and L5-S1.
- **Impression: L5-S1 left posterolateral disc herniation with S1 nerve root compression. L4-L5 diffuse bulge without significant stenosis. Early lumbar spondylosis.**

### Nerve Conduction Study / EMG (Left Lower Limb)
| Nerve / Muscle | Finding |
|---|---|
| Left S1 nerve (H-reflex) | **Prolonged latency** (consistent with S1 radiculopathy) |
| Left tibial nerve (motor) | Normal conduction velocity, mildly reduced amplitude |
| Left peroneal nerve (motor) | Normal |
| Left gastrocnemius (needle EMG) | **Positive sharp waves, fibrillation potentials** — active denervation |
| Left tibialis anterior (needle EMG) | Normal |
| **Conclusion** | **Left S1 radiculopathy — acute-on-chronic, moderate severity** |

---

## Assessment & Diagnosis
1. **Left L5-S1 disc herniation** with left S1 radiculopathy (acute-on-chronic)
   - Motor weakness (L5: 4/5, S1: 4+/5), sensory deficit, diminished ankle reflex
   - EMG confirmation of active denervation
2. **Lumbar spondylosis** — early degenerative disc disease (L4-L5, L5-S1)
3. **Known comorbidities**: T2DM, HTN, NAFLD, dyslipidemia (all managed)
4. **Risk factors for poor healing**: Diabetes, overweight, sedentary occupation, former smoker

## Plan

### Conservative Management (First-line — 6-week trial)
1. **Pregabalin** 75 mg BD (neuropathic pain — titrate to 150 mg BD if tolerated)
2. **Etoricoxib** 60 mg OD × 2 weeks (COX-2 selective — safer than Ibuprofen given GI history; take with PPI cover)
3. **Thiocolchicoside** 4 mg BD × 2 weeks (muscle relaxant)
4. **Methylcobalamin** 1500 µg OD (nerve recovery support)
5. Continue **Paracetamol** 650 mg PRN for breakthrough pain

### Physical Therapy (Critical)
6. **Physiotherapy referral** — structured 6-week program:
   - Week 1–2: Pain management — heat therapy, TENS, gentle McKenzie extension exercises
   - Week 3–4: Core stabilization — transversus abdominis activation, pelvic tilts, bridging
   - Week 5–6: Progressive strengthening — bird-dog, dead bugs, modified planks
7. **Ergonomic assessment** of workplace — standing desk recommendation, lumbar support cushion
8. **Avoid**: Prolonged sitting > 30 min, forward bending, heavy lifting (> 5 kg), high-impact activities

### Red Flag Monitoring
9. **Urgent surgical referral if**: Cauda equina symptoms (bowel/bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia), progressive motor weakness, or intractable pain despite 6 weeks of conservative management
10. Patient educated on red flag signs — written handout provided

### Interventional (If conservative fails)
11. **Epidural steroid injection** (transforaminal, left L5-S1) — to be considered at 6-week follow-up if symptoms persist
12. If injection fails → **Microdiscectomy** discussion (patient counseled)

### Follow-up
13. **2-week phone follow-up** — medication tolerance, pain scores
14. **6-week in-person review** — repeat neurological exam, reassess motor power, therapy progress
15. Repeat MRI only if symptoms worsen or surgical planning needed
16. Coordinate with Dr. Sharma regarding diabetes and BP management (both above target)
