## Chief Complaint
Persistent chest tightness and shortness of breath during moderate physical activity for the past 3 weeks. Episodes last 5–10 minutes and resolve with rest.

## History of Present Illness
Mr. Mehta reports progressive exertional dyspnea beginning approximately 3 weeks ago. He describes a "squeezing" sensation in the center of his chest that radiates to the left arm during brisk walking or climbing stairs. Denies syncope, palpitations at rest, or nocturnal dyspnea. He has been managing T2DM and hypertension for several years. Former smoker — quit in 2023 (15 pack-year history). Father had MI at age 58. He notes his back pain (see Orthopedic consult, November 2025) has improved significantly with physiotherapy, and he recently resumed walking for exercise — which is when the chest symptoms were first noticed.

## Known Comorbidities
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (since 2014, on Metformin 1000 mg BD)
- Essential Hypertension (since 2020, Amlodipine 5 mg OD)
- Dyslipidemia (on Atorvastatin 20 mg OD since June 2025)
- NAFLD — Grade II (diagnosed June 2025)
- GERD — H. pylori eradicated (confirmed October 2025)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### ECG (12-Lead)
- Sinus rhythm, rate 86 bpm
- ST-segment depression (1.5 mm) in leads V4–V6
- No pathological Q waves
- Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria (SV1 + RV5 > 35 mm)
- **Compared to ECG June 2025: NEW ST changes in V4–V6 and new LVH**

### 2D Echocardiography
| Parameter | Value | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Ejection Fraction | **52%** | > 55% (mildly reduced) |
| LV wall thickness (IVSd) | 12 mm | < 11 mm (**increased**) |
| LV internal diameter (diastole) | 52 mm | < 56 mm (normal) |

## Assessment & Diagnosis
1. **Stable Angina Pectoris** (CCS Class II) — chest pain on moderate exertion
2. **Moderate Coronary Artery Disease** — proximal LAD 50–60%, mid-RCA 40–50% (CTCA)
3. **Positive stress test** — inducible ischemia at intermediate workload
4. **Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus** — HbA1c worsened to 7.8% (likely reduced exercise during back pain episode + dietary non-compliance)
5. **Worsening Dyslipidemia** — LDL 156, up from 138 (June 2025) — query statin adherence
6. **Stage 1 Hypertension** — persistently not at goal across multiple visits
7. **Mildly reduced EF** (52%) with LVH — hypertensive heart disease
8. **Declining renal function** — eGFR dropped from 92 (June 2025) to 78 (diabetic nephropathy screening needed)
9. **Overweight** — BMI 28.7, weight gain 4 kg in 7 months

## Risk Stratification
- **Framingham 10-year CVD risk**: ~18% (high)
- Multiple risk factors: DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, smoking history, family history, central obesity, elevated hs-CRP
- Currently managed medically — no indication for invasive angiography at this time (no high-grade stenosis, no ACS)

## Plan

### Optimize Anti-Anginal Therapy
1. **Start Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg OD** — rate control + anti-anginal (titrate to 50 mg based on HR)
2. Start **Isosorbide Mononitrate (sustained release) 30 mg OD** — for breakthrough angina
3. Start **Nicorandil 5 mg BD** — additional anti-ischemic cover
4. Keep Sublingual **Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN) 0.5 mg** — SOS for acute chest pain episodes

### Aggressive Risk Factor Modification
5. **Increase Atorvastatin to 40 mg OD** — target LDL < 70 mg/dL (very high risk category)
6. **Add Telmisartan 40 mg OD** — replace Amlodipine (provides renal protection + BP control for diabetic patient)
7. Continue **Aspirin 75 mg OD**
8. **Add Clopidogrel 75 mg OD** — dual antiplatelet given moderate CAD (3-month course, then review)
9. **Start Empagliflozin 10 mg OD** — SGLT2 inhibitor for cardio-renal benefit + glycemic control (proven CV outcome benefit)
10. Continue Metformin 1000 mg BD

### Lifestyle (Reinforced — Patient Counseled Extensively)
11. **Cardiac rehabilitation program** — supervised exercise 3x/week (medically guided, low-to-moderate intensity)
12. **Dietary overhaul**: Mediterranean/DASH diet. Dietitian re-referral. Target: 500 kcal/day deficit for weight loss.
13. **Strict sodium restriction**: < 5 g/day
14. **No alcohol** (given NAFLD and cardiovascular risk)
15. **Smoking cessation**: Reinforced (already quit 2023 — relapse prevention counseling)

### Monitoring
16. **Follow-up in 2 weeks** — BP check, HR on beta-blocker, symptom assessment
17. **Repeat HbA1c + lipid panel in 3 months** — check response to intensified therapy
18. **Urine microalbumin**: To assess for early diabetic nephropathy (given eGFR decline)
19. **Repeat Echo in 6 months** — monitor EF trend and LVH
20. **Invasive coronary angiography** — only if symptoms worsen, stress test remains positive on optimal medical therapy, or ACS event occurs
