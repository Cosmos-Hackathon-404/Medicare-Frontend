## Chief Complaint
Referred by cardiology for comprehensive diabetes management following cardiac evaluation. Patient reports persistent fatigue, increased thirst, frequent urination (nocturia 2–3x/night), and intermittent blurry vision over the past 2 months. Concerned about worsening sugar control despite medications.

## History of Present Illness
Mr. Mehta is a 42-year-old male with a 12-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, referred following a recent cardiology evaluation (January 2026) that revealed moderate CAD, stable angina, and worsening HbA1c (7.8%, up from 7.0% in September 2025). He admits to significant dietary non-compliance during his back pain episode (November 2025 – December 2025) when he was largely sedentary and relied on convenience foods. He reports polyuria (increased from baseline), polydipsia, nocturia 2–3 times per night, and intermittent blurry vision (distance). He denies numbness/tingling in hands or feet (beyond the resolving S1 radiculopathy). He reports occasional erectile dysfunction over the past 6 months — has not discussed previously. No hypoglycemic episodes reported (no sweating, tremor, or confusion).

His diabetes self-management has been inconsistent: blood glucose self-monitoring done only 2–3 times per week (should be daily), no carbohydrate counting, and no structured meal plan followed. He was started on Empagliflozin 10 mg in January 2026 by cardiology.

## Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) — 14-Day Libre Sensor Data

### Summary Metrics
| Metric | Value | Target (ADA 2026) |
|---|---|---|
| Time in Range (70–180 mg/dL) | **54%** | > 70% |

### Pattern Analysis
| Pattern | Details |
|---|---|
| **Post-dinner spikes** | Consistently > 250 mg/dL between 9:00–11:00 PM (rice + late eating) |
| **Dawn phenomenon** | Fasting glucose rises from ~130 at 3 AM to 160–170 by 7 AM |
| **Post-lunch variability** | Moderate spikes (180–220) — depends on meal composition |
| **Best-controlled period** | 6:00 AM – 8:00 AM (Metformin + Empagliflozin working overnight) |
| **Mild hypoglycemia** | 2 episodes — both around 3:00 PM (missed lunch) — nadir 62, 66 mg/dL |

---

## Assessment & Diagnosis
1. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus — Uncontrolled** (HbA1c 7.6%, TIR 54%)
   - Significant post-prandial hyperglycemia (especially dinner)
   - Dawn phenomenon contributing to fasting glucose elevation
   - Significant insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 8.7) with preserved beta-cell function (C-peptide normal)
   - LADA ruled out (GAD-65 negative)
2. **Diabetic Nephropathy — Stage A2 (Microalbuminuria)** — ACR 52 mg/g, eGFR 82
3. **Mild Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR)** — left eye (NEW finding)
4. **Possible progression to NASH** — rising liver enzymes, FIB-4 approaching intermediate risk
5. **Borderline low testosterone** — likely related to metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes
6. **Vitamin D insufficiency** — improving but not yet replete
7. **Moderate CAD with stable angina** — on optimized cardiac medications
8. **Metabolic Syndrome** — meets all 5 criteria (central obesity, elevated TG, low HDL, elevated BP, elevated FBG)

## Diabetes Complications Screening Summary
| Complication | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Retinopathy** | Mild NPDR (left eye) — NEW | Ophthalmology 6-month follow-up |
| **Nephropathy** | Microalbuminuria (ACR 52) | ACEi/ARB optimization (already on Telmisartan) |
| **Neuropathy** | No diabetic neuropathy detected (foot exam normal) | Annual screening |
| **Cardiovascular** | Moderate CAD, stable angina, EF 52% | Cardiology co-management |
| **Peripheral vascular** | Pulses intact, ABI not done | ABI at next visit |

## Plan

### Glycemic Intensification
1. **Continue Metformin** 1000 mg BD — cornerstone therapy
2. **Continue Empagliflozin** 10 mg OD — cardio-renal benefits (already started by cardiology)
3. **ADD: Sitagliptin 100 mg OD** (DPP-4 inhibitor) — complements Metformin, targets post-prandial glucose, weight-neutral, renal-dose adjusted at eGFR < 45
   *(Chose DPP-4 over GLP-1 RA for now due to patient preference for oral medications. GLP-1 RA to be reconsidered if HbA1c doesn't reach < 7.0% in 3 months.)*
4. **Optimize Metformin timing**: Take 30 minutes before meals (not with meals) for better post-prandial coverage
5. **Target HbA1c**: < 7.0% at 3-month review; < 6.5% long-term if achievable without hypoglycemia

### Post-Prandial Spike Management (CGM-Guided)
6. **Dinner modifications** (highest priority — CGM shows worst spikes):
   - Reduce refined carbs: Replace white rice with brown rice / millets (jowar, bajra)
   - Portion control: ½ plate vegetables, ¼ plate protein, ¼ plate complex carbs
   - **Dinner by 7:30 PM** (currently eating at 9:00–9:30 PM)
   - 10-minute post-dinner walk (proven to reduce post-prandial glucose by 30–40 mg/dL)
7. **Pre-meal protein load**: 15–20 g protein before main carb-containing meals (reduces post-prandial spike)

### Dawn Phenomenon
8. Consider moving Metformin ER (extended-release) 1000 mg to bedtime if switching formulation is possible — better overnight coverage

### Diabetic Nephropathy
9. **Continue Telmisartan 40 mg OD** — renal protection (already prescribed by cardiology)
10. **Empagliflozin** — also provides nephroprotection (dual benefit)
11. **Target BP**: < 130/80 mmHg (current 132/82 — nearly at goal on new regimen)
12. **Repeat ACR in 3 months** — confirm persistent microalbuminuria
13. **Quarterly eGFR monitoring** — track trajectory

### Diabetic Retinopathy
14. **Ophthalmology follow-up in 6 months** — repeat dilated fundoscopy
15. Urgent review if new visual symptoms (floaters, flashes, sudden vision loss)
16. **Tight glycemic and BP control** — most effective retinopathy prevention

### NAFLD / Possible NASH Progression
17. **FibroScan (Transient Elastography)** ordered — to assess hepatic fibrosis grade
18. If FibroScan > 7.5 kPa → hepatology referral
19. **Weight loss** is the single most effective intervention — target 7% body weight loss (6 kg)
20. **Pioglitazone** consideration if NASH confirmed (improves steatohepatitis) — but may cause weight gain; defer for now

### Testosterone / Sexual Health
21. **Repeat testosterone** (8 AM fasting sample) in 3 months — current value borderline; may improve with weight loss and glycemic control
22. If confirmed low + persisting ED → urology referral for evaluation

### Supplementation
23. **Vitamin D3** 2,000 IU daily — continue (improving trend: 16 → 28 ng/mL)
24. **Vitamin B12** monitoring every 6 months — Metformin can cause deficiency over time

### Self-Management Education
25. **CGM**: Continue Libre sensor — re-apply in 1 month (insurance covers intermittent use)
26. **Glucometer SMBG** between CGM periods: Fasting + 2-hr post-dinner daily (minimum)
27. **Diabetes self-management education (DSME)** session scheduled — covers carbohydrate counting, sick-day rules, hypoglycemia management, foot care
28. **Podiatry referral** — annual diabetic foot care + onychomycosis treatment

### Follow-up Schedule
29. **4-week follow-up** — review new CGM data, Sitagliptin tolerance, weight trend, BP
30. **3-month follow-up** — HbA1c, lipid panel, ACR, eGFR, LFTs, testosterone recheck
31. **6-month follow-up** — comprehensive diabetes review + ophthalmology
32. **Coordinate with**: Dr. Menon (Cardiology), Dr. Sharma (GP), Dr. Joshi (Ortho — for exercise clearance)
